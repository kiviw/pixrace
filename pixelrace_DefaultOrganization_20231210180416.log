**task_prompt**: Develop a peer-to-peer marketplace in PHP for both digital and physical goods, operating on an Apache server. Transactions will exclusively use Monero, with users obtaining a unique Monero subaddress at registration via Monero RPC on localhost:18080. User-associated subaddresses will be maintained for transactions. Implement a captcha at registration and login, utilizing an open-source, alphanumeric five-figure combination to thwart bots. Ensure PHP script compatibility with Ubuntu 22 server, Apache webserver, and PHP 8. The marketplace, designed with a dark theme and blue text, should be mobile-responsive, displaying Monero account balances at the top. Use CoinGecko API for USD conversion, showing rates in the footer. Products should feature dual pricing in Monero and USD. Allow user withdrawals to Monero addresses, manually processed by the admin upon withdrawal requests. Deposits are automatically credited after at least 2 confirmations, confirmed by Monero wallet RPC. Buyer-seller messaging will be encrypted using PGP tied to user registrations. Admin intervention in disputes is enabled. PGP keys serve as the sole means for password recovery. Admin-managed product categories and an inclusive forum for user discussions are incorporated. Admin dashboard control includes editing hostname, port, and overseeing user withdrawal requests.

According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below: 

Task: "Develop a peer-to-peer marketplace in PHP for both digital and physical goods, operating on an Apache server.

Modality: "website".

Programming Language: " PHP"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  PHP. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

| **task_prompt** | Develop a peer-to-peer marketplace in PHP for both digital and physical goods, operating on an Apache server. Transactions will exclusively use Monero, with users obtaining a unique Monero subaddress at registration via Monero RPC on localhost:18080. User-associated subaddresses will be maintained for transactions. Implement a captcha at registration and login, utilizing an open-source, alphanumeric five-figure combination to thwart bots. Ensure PHP script compatibility with Ubuntu 22 server, Apache webserver, and PHP 8. The marketplace, designed with a dark theme and blue text, should be mobile-responsive, displaying Monero account balances at the top. Use CoinGecko API for USD conversion, showing rates in the footer. Products should feature dual pricing in Monero and USD. Allow user withdrawals to Monero addresses, manually processed by the admin upon withdrawal requests. Deposits are automatically credited after at least 2 confirmations, confirmed by Monero wallet RPC. Buyer-seller messaging will be encrypted using PGP tied to user registrations. Admin intervention in disputes is enabled. PGP keys serve as the sole means for password recovery. Admin-managed product categories and an inclusive forum for user discussions are incorporated. Admin dashboard control includes editing hostname, port, and overseeing user withdrawal requests. |

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

<Comment>
The highest priority comment is related to the implementation of the Monero RPC functionality. Currently, the code references a non-existent `MoneroRpc` class and attempts to use it to interact with the Monero RPC server. To fix this, you need to implement the `MoneroRpc` class and its methods to handle the communication with the Monero RPC server.

Here are the steps to fix this issue:

1. Create a new file called `MoneroRpc.php` in the `classes` directory.
2. In the `MoneroRpc.php` file, define the `MoneroRpc` class.
3. Implement the necessary methods in the `MoneroRpc` class to interact with the Monero RPC server, such as `getBalance()`.
4. In the `updateMoneroBalance()` method of the `User` class, instantiate the `MoneroRpc` class and use it to retrieve the user's Monero balance.
5. Update the user's balance in the database and in the `User` object.

Once you have implemented the `MoneroRpc` class and updated the `User` class, the Monero RPC functionality should work correctly.

Please let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.

Comments on Codes:
"<Comment>
The highest priority comment is related to the implementation of the Monero RPC functionality. Currently, the code references a non-existent `MoneroRpc` class and attempts to use it to interact with the Monero RPC server. To fix this, you need to implement the `MoneroRpc` class and its methods to handle the communication with the Monero RPC server.

Here are the steps to fix this issue:

1. Create a new file called `MoneroRpc.php` in the `classes` directory.
2. In the `MoneroRpc.php` file, define the `MoneroRpc` class.
3. Implement the necessary methods in the `MoneroRpc` class to interact with the Monero RPC server, such as `getBalance()`.
4. In the `updateMoneroBalance()` method of the `User` class, instantiate the `MoneroRpc` class and use it to retrieve the user's Monero balance.
5. Update the user's balance in the database and in the `User` object.

Once you have implemented the `MoneroRpc` class and updated the `User` class, the Monero RPC functionality should work correctly.

Please let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of "changing the digital world through programming".
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Develop a peer-to-peer marketplace in PHP for both digital and physical goods, operating on an Apache server. Transactions will exclusively use Monero, with users obtaining a unique Monero subaddress at registration via Monero RPC on localhost:18080. User-associated subaddresses will be maintained for transactions. Implement a captcha at registration and login, utilizing an open-source, alphanumeric five-figure combination to thwart bots. Ensure PHP script compatibility with Ubuntu 22 server, Apache webserver, and PHP 8. The marketplace, designed with a dark theme and blue text, should be mobile-responsive, displaying Monero account balances at the top. Use CoinGecko API for USD conversion, showing rates in the footer. Products should feature dual pricing in Monero and USD. Allow user withdrawals to Monero addresses, manually processed by the admin upon withdrawal requests. Deposits are automatically credited after at least 2 confirmations, confirmed by Monero wallet RPC. Buyer-seller messaging will be encrypted using PGP tied to user registrations. Admin intervention in disputes is enabled. PGP keys serve as the sole means for password recovery. Admin-managed product categories and an inclusive forum for user discussions are incorporated. Admin dashboard control includes editing hostname, port, and overseeing user withdrawal requests..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Create a new file called MoneroRpc.php in the classes directory.\n2. In the MoneroRpc.php file, define the MoneroRpc class.\n3. Implement the necessary methods in the MoneroRpc class to interact with the Monero RPC server, such as getBalance().\n4. In the updateMoneroBalance() method of the User class, instantiate the MoneroRpc class and use it to retrieve the user's Monero balance.\n5. Update the user's balance in the database and in the User object.\n\nOnce you have implemented the MoneroRpc class and updated the User class, the Monero RPC functionality should work correctly.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance."} |

<Comment>
The highest priority comment is that the code is missing the implementation of several methods in the classes User, Product, Transaction, Message, and Admin. These methods are necessary for the functionality of the marketplace. 

To fix this, you need to implement the missing methods in each class according to the requirements of the marketplace. Make sure to include the necessary logic and functionality to handle user-related operations, product management, transaction handling, messaging, and admin tasks.

Additionally, it is important to add comments to each method to explain its purpose, input parameters, and return values. This will improve code readability and maintainability.

Once you have implemented the missing methods and added the necessary comments, the code should be ready for further testing and integration with the marketplace functionality.

Please let me know if you need any further assistance or clarification.

| **task_prompt** | Develop a peer-to-peer marketplace in PHP for both digital and physical goods, operating on an Apache server. Transactions will exclusively use Monero, with users obtaining a unique Monero subaddress at registration via Monero RPC on localhost:18080. User-associated subaddresses will be maintained for transactions. Implement a captcha at registration and login, utilizing an open-source, alphanumeric five-figure combination to thwart bots. Ensure PHP script compatibility with Ubuntu 22 server, Apache webserver, and PHP 8. The marketplace, designed with a dark theme and blue text, should be mobile-responsive, displaying Monero account balances at the top. Use CoinGecko API for USD conversion, showing rates in the footer. Products should feature dual pricing in Monero and USD. Allow user withdrawals to Monero addresses, manually processed by the admin upon withdrawal requests. Deposits are automatically credited after at least 2 confirmations, confirmed by Monero wallet RPC. Buyer-seller messaging will be encrypted using PGP tied to user registrations.

Comments on Codes:
"<Comment>
The highest priority comment is that the code is missing the implementation of several methods in the classes User, Product, Transaction, Message, and Admin. These methods are necessary for the functionality of the marketplace. 

To fix this, you need to implement the missing methods in each class according to the requirements of the marketplace. Make sure to include the necessary logic and functionality to handle user-related operations, product management, transaction handling, messaging, and admin tasks.

Additionally, it is important to add comments to each method to explain its purpose, input parameters, and return values. This will improve code readability and maintainability.

Once you have implemented the missing methods and added the necessary comments, the code should be ready for further testing and integration with the marketplace functionality.

Please let me know if you need any further assistance or clarification."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

[2023-10-12 18:09:56 INFO] Programmer: **Programmer<->Code Reviewer on : CodeReviewModification, turn 0**

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of "changing the digital world through programming".
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Develop a peer-to-peer marketplace in PHP for both digital and physical goods, operating on an Apache server. Transactions will exclusively use Monero, with users obtaining a unique Monero subaddress at registration via Monero RPC on localhost:18080. User-associated subaddresses will be maintained for transactions. Implement a captcha at registration and login, utilizing an open-source, alphanumeric five-figure combination to thwart bots. Ensure PHP script compatibility with Ubuntu 22 server, Apache webserver, and PHP 8. The marketplace, designed with a dark theme and blue text, should be mobile-responsive, displaying Monero account balances at the top. Use CoinGecko API for USD conversion, showing rates in the footer. Products should feature dual pricing in Monero and USD. Allow user withdrawals to Monero addresses, manually processed by the admin upon withdrawal requests. Deposits are automatically credited after at least 2 confirmations, confirmed by Monero wallet RPC. Buyer-seller messaging will be encrypted using PGP tied to user registrations. Admin intervention in disputes is enabled. PGP keys serve as the sole means for password recovery. Admin-managed product categories and an inclusive forum for user discussions are incorporated. Admin dashboard control includes editing hostname, port, and overseeing user withdrawal requests..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of "changing the digital world through programming".
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Develop a peer-to-peer marketplace in PHP for both digital and physical goods, operating on an Apache server. Transactions will exclusively use Monero, with users obtaining a unique Monero subaddress at registration via Monero RPC on localhost:18080. User-associated subaddresses will be maintained for transactions. Implement a captcha at registration and login, utilizing an open-source, alphanumeric five-figure combination to thwart bots. Ensure PHP script compatibility with Ubuntu 22 server, Apache webserver, and PHP 8. The marketplace, designed with a dark theme and blue text, should be mobile-responsive, displaying Monero account balances at the top. Use CoinGecko API for USD conversion, showing rates in the footer. Products should feature dual pricing in Monero and USD. Allow user withdrawals to Monero addresses, manually processed by the admin upon withdrawal requests. Deposits are automatically credited after at least 2 confirmations, confirmed by Monero wallet RPC. Buyer-seller messaging will be encrypted using PGP tied to user registrations. Admin intervention in disputes is enabled. PGP keys serve as the sole means for password recovery. Admin-managed product categories and an inclusive forum for user discussions are incorporated. Admin dashboard control includes editing hostname, port, and overseeing user withdrawal requests..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

<Comment>
The highest priority comment is regarding the security of the user passwords. Currently, the passwords are not being properly hashed and stored in the database, which is a major security vulnerability. To fix this, you should implement password hashing using a secure algorithm like bcrypt or Argon2. Additionally, you should also add salt to the passwords before hashing to further enhance security.

You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Develop a peer-to-peer marketplace in PHP for both digital and physical goods, operating on an Apache server. Transactions will exclusively use Monero, with users obtaining a unique Monero subaddress at registration via Monero RPC on localhost:18080. User-associated subaddresses will be maintained for transactions. Implement a captcha at registration and login, utilizing an open-source, alphanumeric five-figure combination to thwart bots. Ensure PHP script compatibility with Ubuntu 22 server, Apache webserver, and PHP 8. The marketplace, designed with a dark theme and blue text, should be mobile-responsive, displaying Monero account balances at the top. Use CoinGecko API for USD conversion, showing rates in the footer. Products should feature dual pricing in Monero and USD. Allow user withdrawals to Monero addresses, manually processed by the admin upon withdrawal requests. Deposits are automatically credited after at least 2 confirmations, confirmed by Monero wallet RPC. Buyer-seller messaging will be encrypted using PGP tied to user registrations. Admin intervention in disputes is enabled. PGP keys serve as the sole means for password recovery. Admin-managed product categories and an inclusive forum for user discussions are incorporated. Admin dashboard control includes editing hostname, port, and overseeing user withdrawal requests..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

| **task_prompt** | Develop a peer-to-peer marketplace in PHP for both digital and physical goods, operating on an Apache server. Transactions will exclusively use Monero, with users obtaining a unique Monero subaddress at registration via Monero RPC on localhost:18080. User-associated subaddresses will be maintained for transactions. Implement a captcha at registration and login, utilizing an open-source, alphanumeric five-figure combination to thwart bots. Ensure PHP script compatibility with Ubuntu 22 server, Apache webserver, and PHP 8. The marketplace, designed with a dark theme and blue text, should be mobile-responsive, displaying Monero account balances at the top. Use CoinGecko API for USD conversion, showing rates in the footer. Products should feature dual pricing in Monero and USD. Allow user withdrawals to Monero addresses, manually processed by the admin upon withdrawal requests. Deposits are automatically credited after at least 2 confirmations, confirmed by Monero wallet RPC. Buyer-seller messaging will be encrypted using PGP tied to user registrations. Admin intervention in disputes is enabled. PGP keys serve as the sole means for password recovery. Admin-managed product categories and an inclusive forum for user discussions are incorporated. Admin dashboard control includes editing hostname, port, and overseeing user withdrawal requests. |

To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Since the provided codes are written in PHP, a requirements.txt file is not applicable in this case. The requirements.txt file is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

In PHP, dependencies and packages are typically managed using Composer, a dependency management tool for PHP. To specify the dependencies for a PHP project, you would use a composer.json file instead.

Here's an example of a composer.json file that specifies the dependencies for a PHP project:

composer.json

```
{
    "require": {
        "monolog/monolog": "^2.0",
        "guzzlehttp/guzzle": "^7.0"
    }
}
```

In this example, the project requires the Monolog and Guzzle HTTP client libraries. The "^" symbol indicates that the project can use any version that is compatible with the specified version range.

To use Composer, you would need to install it on your system and run the `composer install` command in the project directory. This will download and install the required dependencies based on the composer.json file.

Please note that the provided codes do not include any specific dependencies or packages. If your project requires additional libraries or frameworks, you would need to add them to the composer.json file accordingly.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: Since the provided codes are written in PHP, a requirements.txt file is not applicable in this case. The requirements.txt file is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.
In PHP, dependencies and packages are typically managed using Composer, a dependency management tool for PHP. To specify the dependencies for a PHP project, you would use a composer.json file instead.
Here's an example of a composer.json file that specifies the dependencies for a PHP project:
composer.json
```
{
    "require": {
        "monolog/monolog": "^2.0",
        "guzzlehttp/guzzle": "^7.0"
    }
}
```
In this example, the project requires the Monolog and Guzzle HTTP client libraries. The "^" symbol indicates that the project can use any version that is compatible with the specified version range.
To use Composer, you would need to install it on your system and run the `composer install` command in the project directory. This will download and install the required dependencies based on the composer.json file.
Please note that the provided codes do not include any specific dependencies or packages. If your project requires additional libraries or frameworks, you would need to add them to the composer.json file accordingly. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

[2023-10-12 18:13:14 INFO] Chief Executive Officer: **Chief Executive Officer<->Counselor on : Reflection, turn 0**

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of "changing the digital world through programming".
You are Counselor. Now, we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities include asking what user and customer think and provide your valuable suggestions. 
Here is a new customer's task: Develop a peer-to-peer marketplace in PHP for both digital and physical goods, operating on an Apache server. Transactions will exclusively use Monero, with users obtaining a unique Monero subaddress at registration via Monero RPC on localhost:18080. User-associated subaddresses will be maintained for transactions. Implement a captcha at registration and login, utilizing an open-source, alphanumeric five-figure combination to thwart bots. Ensure PHP script compatibility with Ubuntu 22 server, Apache webserver, and PHP 8. The marketplace, designed with a dark theme and blue text, should be mobile-responsive, displaying Monero account balances at the top. Use CoinGecko API for USD conversion, showing rates in the footer. Products should feature dual pricing in Monero and USD. Allow user withdrawals to Monero addresses, manually processed by the admin upon withdrawal requests. Deposits are automatically credited after at least 2 confirmations, confirmed by Monero wallet RPC. Buyer-seller messaging will be encrypted using PGP tied to user registrations. Admin intervention in disputes is enabled. PGP keys serve as the sole means for password recovery. Admin-managed product categories and an inclusive forum for user discussions are incorporated. Admin dashboard control includes editing hostname, port, and overseeing user withdrawal requests..
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

As mentioned earlier, a requirements.txt file is not applicable for PHP projects. Instead, PHP projects typically use Composer to manage dependencies. In this case, since the provided codes do not include any specific dependencies or packages, there is no need to create a composer.json file.

However, if your project requires additional libraries or frameworks, you would need to add them to the composer.json file. Here's an example of how you can modify the composer.json file to include additional dependencies:

composer.json
```json
{
    "require": {
        "monolog/monolog": "^2.0",
        "guzzlehttp/guzzle": "^7.0",
        "your-library/package": "^1.0"
    }
}
```

In this example, "your-library/package" represents the name of the library or package you want to include, and "^1.0" indicates that the project can use any version that is compatible with version 1.0.

After modifying the composer.json file, you can run the `composer install` command in the project directory to download and install the required dependencies.

Remember to replace "your-library/package" with the actual name of the library or package you want to include, and specify the appropriate version range based on your project's requirements.

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)
