Task:
Develop a peer-to-peer marketplace in PHP for both digital and physical goods, operating on an Apache server. Transactions will exclusively use Monero, with users obtaining a unique Monero subaddress at registration via Monero RPC on localhost:18080. User-associated subaddresses will be maintained for transactions. Implement a captcha at registration and login, utilizing an open-source, alphanumeric five-figure combination to thwart bots. Ensure PHP script compatibility with Ubuntu 22 server, Apache webserver, and PHP 8. The marketplace, designed with a dark theme and blue text, should be mobile-responsive, displaying Monero account balances at the top. Use CoinGecko API for USD conversion, showing rates in the footer. Products should feature dual pricing in Monero and USD. Allow user withdrawals to Monero addresses, manually processed by the admin upon withdrawal requests. Deposits are automatically credited after at least 2 confirmations, confirmed by Monero wallet RPC. Buyer-seller messaging will be encrypted using PGP tied to user registrations. Admin intervention in disputes is enabled. PGP keys serve as the sole means for password recovery. Admin-managed product categories and an inclusive forum for user discussions are incorporated. Admin dashboard control includes editing hostname, port, and overseeing user withdrawal requests.
